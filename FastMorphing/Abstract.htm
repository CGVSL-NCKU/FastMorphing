line-height:150%"><span lang="EN-US">In&nbsp; this paper, we present a very fast 
      and intuitive approach to generate the metamorphosis of two genus 0 3D 
      polyhedral models. There are two levels of correspondence specified by 
      animators to control morphs. The higher level requires the animators to 
      specify scatter features to decompose the input models into several 
      corresponding patches. The lower level optionally allows the animators to 
      specify extra features on each corresponding patch for the finer control 
      of correspondence. Once these two levels of correspondence are 
      established, the proposed schemes automatically and efficiently establish 
      a complete one-to-one correspondence between two models. The performance 
      of the proposed methods is comparable to or even much better than the 
      state-of-the-art in 3D polyhedral metamorphosis. We demonstrate several 
      examples of aesthetically pleasing morphs, which can be very fast and 
      intuitively created with little user interaction times.</span></p>
