<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify; 
text-justify:inter-ideograph;line-height:150%"><span lang="EN-US">We have  
presented techniques for computing shape transitions between polygonal 3D  
objects. These techniques have proven to be fast and intuitive methods for 3D  
polygon morphing. Our technique does not require too much user interaction time  
in contrast to other previous wok [3,5]. Furthermore, the proposed embedding and  
merging methods perform well to be comparable to or even much better than  
the-state-of-art. In the evaluated examples, both are computed very fast (less  
than 1 or 2 seconds). A number of researches can be done in near future. For  
example, we can replace the linear interpolation with other alternative to avoid  
self-intersection. The merged embedding usually has about 2 to 5 times as many  
triangles and vertices as the input models. We plan to design a new method of 3D  
morphing without the requirement of the embedding merging. The morphing shapes  
can automatically adjust the number of triangles and vertices in need.</span></p>
