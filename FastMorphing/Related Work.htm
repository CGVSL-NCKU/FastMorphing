line-height:150%"><span lang="EN-US">Lazarus and Verroust [1] give an excellent 
survey of previous work on the 3D morphing problem. There are two major classes 
of 3D morphing technique: volume based approach and surface based approach. In 
this paper, we focus on surface based approach. For more related work of 
volume-based approach, please refer to [1]. The surface based approach works on 
boundary representations such as polyhedral meshes or patch complexes. Methods 
for this approach usually create an interpolation mesh, which is a common 
embedding of both source and target meshes. This interpolation mesh is then 
geometrically deformed to create morphed shapes. This common embedding solves 
the correspondence problem, associating the vertices or triangles between the 
source mesh and target mesh. This is a key issue of surface based approach and 
will be the focus of our paper.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;A lot of work has been published in 
the correspondence issue. Kent et al [6] introduce parameterizations for solving 
the correspondence problem. Their approach projected star-shaped objects onto 
spheres to accomplish parameterization. Similarly, Alexa [4] employs a 
relaxation method to embed polyhedral shapes on the spheres. Lazarus and 
Verroust [7] introduce skeletons for cylinder-like objects. This approach is an 
extension of [6] for objects that are star-shaped around an axis. Parent [8] 
presents a recursive algorithm that automatically finds a correspondence between 
the surfaces of two objects of equivalent topologies. Decarlo et al. [9] present 
a method to transform objects with different topologies. The user must identify 
a sparse control mesh on each surface of objects and this control mesh specifies 
how to transform one surface to another. Therefore, it will become very 
complicated and difficult to transform complex shapes. Kanai et al. [10] and 
Zockler et al. [5] utilize mesh parameterization technique such as harmonic 
mapping to embed a region of a mesh to a 2D convex polygon. Gregory et al. [3] 
apply a user-specified control mesh to decompose the surface into a large number 
of disk-like patches. However, this task is very slow and tedious. Lee et al. 
[11] employ the MAPS algorithm [12] to parameterize input meshes over simple 
base domains and an additional harmonic map bringing the latter into the 
correspondence. Their approach can have fold-over problem and user interaction 
is required to manually fix this problem.</span></p>
